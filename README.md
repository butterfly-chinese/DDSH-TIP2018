## Introduction
### 1. Running Environment
Matlab 2016

[MatConvnet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/)
### 2. Datasets
We use four datasets to perform our experiments, i.e., CIFAR-10, SVHN, NUS-WIDE and Clothing1M datasets. In this repo, we use CIFAR-10 dataset as an example.

In addition, pretrained model can be download from the following links:
